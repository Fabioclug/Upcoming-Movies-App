# Upcoming-Movies-App
App for cinephiles and movie hobbyists that shows the list of upcoming movies and allows search of movies by name.

The project was implemented using the MVVM architecture and the [Android paging library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging).

[Koin](https://github.com/InsertKoinIO/koin) was used for dependency injection to decouple classes and make it easier to create some of the needed objects.

Although the logic of HomeActivity and SearchActivity are very alike, the decision was to keep separate activities and ViewModels, in order to allow further additions in a smooth way.
